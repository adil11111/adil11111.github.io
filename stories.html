          <p>At first sight, Hajjah seems a quiet place to live as a child. The city, located 127 kilometers northwest of Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, offers breathtaking views over the surrounding mountains and green valleys, which used to attract many visitors before the conflict escalated in 2015 and before Yemen became one of the worst places on Earth to be a child. More than three years after the beginning of the current war, the situation keeps worsening, with children being the primary victims of this conflict.</p>

					<h2>Ayah's Story</h2>
          <p>“We were deeply sleeping as usual at 12 o’clock at night, and suddenly, a loud explosion shook the house, the sound of the explosive deafened my ears, and I couldn’t hear what was happening around me. I rushed to my children’s room and the sight was shocking. My little children were covered in dust and crying with fear and terror. One of my children pointed to Ayah who I found covered with her blood suffering from serious injuries. After that day, I took her to the nearest hospital and through a miracle, Ayah’s condition stabilized, but sadly she has already lost her left foot. I feel pain every day as I see her missing foot. My heart aches. Ayah is constantly asking me if she can walk back, that question makes me miserable.” <br><br>
